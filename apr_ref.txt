	description: Reads in historical data from CSV into the websocket at the rate specified by the speed parameter.  
	pair: Currency pair to backtest (EURUSD, GBPUSD, etc.)
	start time: Unix timestamp at which to start the simulation (1399092584.5)
	speed: delay in ms between transmission of ticks (100)
	example: http://52.91.212.83:3000/backtest/fast/USDRUB/1399092584.5/100
