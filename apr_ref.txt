<ip>:3000/backtest/fast/<pair>/<start time>/<speed>
	description: Reads in historical data from CSV into the websocket at the rate specified by the speed parameter.  
	pair: Currency pair to backtest (EURUSD, GBPUSD, etc.)
	start time: Unix timestamp at which to start the simulation (1399092584.5)
	speed: delay in ms between transmission of ticks (100)
	example: http://52.91.212.83:3000/backtest/fast/USDRUB/1399092584.5/100

<ip>:3000/backtest/live/<pair>/<start time>
	description: Reads in historical data from CSV into the websocket at simulated real-time speed based on the time between the recorded ticks.
	pair: Currency pair to backtest (EURUSD, GBPUSD, etc.)
	start time: Unix timestamp at which to start the simulation (1399092584.5)

-All data JSON-encoded.  
-Each packet contains a type identifier and data. //{"type":"new_tick","data":{"timestamp":1399097279.29,"ask":0.926,"bid":0.92593}}
-Packet types:
	*new_tick - contains a raw tick from the tick source.  These are live and as recent as it comes.
